Alternative programs for generating G-Code
==========================================

The following list contains only Free Software (GPL/BSD/...):

-   [dxf2gcode](http://code.google.com/p/dxf2gcode/): useful for
    engravings
-   [FreeCAD](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/free-cad/): 3D CAD
    design program; G-Code generation partly integrated (2011)
-   [HeeksCNC](http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/): add-on for
    [HeeksCAD](http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/); requires STEP files
    instead of STL; activity [partly
    abandoned](http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/) by its main
    author (2011)
-   [cam-occ](http://code.google.com/p/cam-occ/): based on solid models
    instead of trimeshs (no recent releases, but development seems to be
    active (2010))
-   [monocam](http://code.google.com/p/monocam/): no official releases,
    yet; no recent development activities (2010)
-   [camvox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/camvox/): no official
    releases, yet; no recent development activities (2010)
-   [gcnccam](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcnccam/): uses DXF as
    input; quite active
-   [CNC Code Generator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cnccodegen/):
    java-based, recently not very active (2010)
-   [GCAM](http://gcam.js.cx): DXF or GERBER input; sparse documentation
