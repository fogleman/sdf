
The DropCutter goes as folows:
1) make lines along the X-axis (Lines)
2) for each line, take a number of samples (Samples)
3) at each sample, drop the cutter until it hits the model, this is a cutter location point
4) connect the cutter location points along the line


The PushCutter goes as follows:
1) make slices along the Z-axis (Levels)
2) make lines along the X-axis (Lines)
3) push the cutter along the line until it hits the model, this is a cutter location
   if we do not hit anything, we're finished
4) skip the parts where the model is above the current z-level
5) go back to 3


The PathAccumulator connects the cutter locations by cutting in between,
it is useful mainly for debugging

The SimpleCutter connects the cutter locations in an on-off (cut/don't cut) pattern,
it is useful only for debugging

The ZigZagCutter connects the cutter locations by cutting in between points,
then come back along the next line in reverse direction.
it is useful mainly in combination with the DropCutter

The PolygonCutter extracts polygonial sections from the cutter scanlines,
then cuts those in a zig-zag pattern
it is useful mainly in combination with the PushCutter

The ContourCutter extracts contours from the cutter scanlines,
it is useful only in combination with the PushCutter
