=head1 GENERAL

=head2 What is Net::DNS?

Net::DNS is a perl implementation of a DNS resolver.  


=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Where can I find Test::More?

Test::More is part of the Test-Simple package, by Michael G Schwern.
You should be able to find the distribution at
	L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/>


=head1 USAGE

=head2 Why does $resolver->query() return undef when the answer section is empty?

The short answer is, do not use query().
$resolver->send() will always return the answer packet,
as long as an answer was received.

The longer answer is that query() is modeled after the res_query() function
from the libresolv C library, which has similar behavior.
