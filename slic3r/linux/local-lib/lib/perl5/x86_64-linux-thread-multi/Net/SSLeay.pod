=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Net::SSLeay> module contains perl bindings to openssl (L<http://www.openssl.org|http://www.openssl.org>) library.

B<COMPATIBILITY NOTE:> L<Net::SSLeay> cannot be built with pre-0.9.3 openssl. It is strongly recommended
to use at least 0.9.7 (as older versions are not tested during development). Some low level API functions
may be available with certain openssl versions.

It is compatible with OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1. Some functions are not available under OpenSSL 1.1.

L<Net::SSLeay> module basically comprise of:

=over

=item * High level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS)

=item * Low level API (mostly mapped 1:1 to openssl's C functions)

=item * Convenience functions (related to low level API but with more perl friendly interface)

=back

There is also a related module called L<Net::SSLeay::Handle> included in this
distribution that you might want to use instead. It has its own pod
documentation.

=head2 High level functions for accessing web servers

This module offers some high level convenience functions for accessing
web pages on SSL servers (for symmetry, the same API is offered for
accessing http servers, too), an C<sslcat()> function for writing your own
clients, and finally access to the SSL api of the SSLeay/OpenSSL package
so you can write servers or clients for more complicated applications.

For high level functions it is most convenient to import them into your
main namespace as indicated in the synopsis.

=head3 Basic set of functions

=over

=item * get_https

=item * post_https

=item * put_https

=item * head_https

=item * do_https

=item * sslcat

=item * https_cat

=item * make_form

=item * make_headers

=back

B<Case 1 (in SYNOPSIS)> demonstrates the typical invocation of get_https() to fetch an HTML
page from secure server. The first argument provides the hostname or IP
in dotted decimal notation of the remote server to contact. The second
argument is the TCP port at the remote end (your own port is picked
arbitrarily from high numbered ports as usual for TCP). The third
argument is the URL of the page without the host name part. If in
doubt consult the HTTP specifications at L<http://www.w3c.org>.

B<Case 2 (in SYNOPSIS)> demonstrates full fledged use of C<get_https()>. As can be seen,
C<get_https()> parses the response and response headers and returns them as
a list, which can be captured in a hash for later reference. Also a
fourth argument to C<get_https()> is used to insert some additional headers
in the request. C<make_headers()> is a function that will convert a list or
hash to such headers. By default C<get_https()> supplies C<Host> (to make
virtual hosting easy) and C<Accept> (reportedly needed by IIS) headers.

B<Case 2b (in SYNOPSIS)> demonstrates how to get a password protected page. Refer to
the HTTP protocol specifications for further details (e.g. RFC-2617).

B<Case 3 (in SYNOPSIS)> invokes C<post_https()> to submit a HTML/CGI form to a secure
server. The first four arguments are equal to C<get_https()> (note that
the empty string (C<''>) is passed as header argument).
The fifth argument is the
contents of the form formatted according to CGI specification. 
Do not post UTF-8 data as content: use utf8::downgrade first. In this
case the helper function C<make_https()> is used to do the formatting,
but you could pass any string. C<post_https()> automatically adds
C<Content-Type> and C<Content-Length> headers to the request.

B<Case 4 (in SYNOPSIS)> shows the fundamental C<sslcat()> function (inspired in spirit by
the C<netcat> utility :-). It's your swiss army knife that allows you to
easily contact servers, send some data, and then get the response. You
are responsible for formatting the data and parsing the response -
C<sslcat()> is just a transport.

B<Case 5 (in SYNOPSIS)> is a full invocation of C<sslcat()> which allows the return of errors
as well as the server (peer) certificate.

The C<$trace> global variable can be used to control the verbosity of the
high level functions. Level 0 guarantees silence, level 1 (the default)
only emits error messages.

=head3 Alternate versions of high-level API

=over

=item * get_https3

=item * post_https3

=item * put_https3

=item * get_https4

=item * post_https4

=item * put_https4

=back

The above mentioned functions actually return the response headers as
a list, which only gets converted to hash upon assignment (this
assignment looses information if the same header occurs twice, as may
be the case with cookies). There are also other variants of the
functions that return unprocessed headers and that return a reference
to a hash.

  ($page, $response, @headers) = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  for ($i = 0; $i < $#headers; $i+=2) {
      print "$headers[$i] = " . $headers[$i+1] . "\n";
  }

  ($page, $response, $headers, $server_cert)
    = get_https3('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  print "$headers\n";

  ($page, $response, $headers_ref)
    = get_https4('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  for $k (sort keys %{$headers_ref}) {
      for $v (@{$$headers_ref{$k}}) {
	  print "$k = $v\n";
      }
  }

All of the above code fragments accomplish the same thing: display all
values of all headers. The API functions ending in "3" return the
headers simply as a scalar string and it is up to the application to
split them up. The functions ending in "4" return a reference to
a hash of arrays (see L<perlref> and L<perllol> if you are
not familiar with complex perl data structures). To access a single value
of such a header hash you would do something like

  print $$headers_ref{COOKIE}[0];

Variants 3 and 4 also allow you to discover the server certificate
in case you would like to store or display it, e.g.

  ($p, $resp, $hdrs, $server_cert) = get_https3('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  if (!defined($server_cert) || ($server_cert == 0)) {
      warn "Subject Name: undefined, Issuer  Name: undefined";
  } else {
      warn 'Subject Name: '
	  . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
		 Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subject_name($server_cert))
	      . 'Issuer  Name: '
		  . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
                         Net::SSLeay::X509_get_issuer_name($server_cert));
  }

Beware that this method only allows after the fact verification of
the certificate: by the time C<get_https3()> has returned the https
request has already been sent to the server, whether you decide to
trust it or not. To do the verification correctly you must either
employ the OpenSSL certificate verification framework or use
the lower level API to first connect and verify the certificate
and only then send the http data. See the implementation of C<ds_https3()>
for guidance on how to do this.

=head3 Using client certificates

Secure web communications are encrypted using symmetric crypto keys
exchanged using encryption based on the certificate of the
server. Therefore in all SSL connections the server must have a
certificate. This serves both to authenticate the server to the
clients and to perform the key exchange.

Sometimes it is necessary to authenticate the client as well. Two
options are available: HTTP basic authentication and a client side
certificate. The basic authentication over HTTPS is actually quite
safe because HTTPS guarantees that the password will not travel in
the clear. Never-the-less, problems like easily guessable passwords
remain. The client certificate method involves authentication of the
client at the SSL level using a certificate. For this to work, both the
client and the server have certificates (which typically are
different) and private keys.

The API functions outlined above accept additional arguments that
allow one to supply the client side certificate and key files. The
format of these files is the same as used for server certificates and
the caveat about encrypting private keys applies.

  ($page, $result, %headers) =                                   # 2c
         = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
	      make_headers(Authorization =>
			   'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode("$user:$pass",'')),
	      '', $mime_type6, $path_to_crt7, $path_to_key8);

  ($page, $response, %reply_headers)
	 = post_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/foo.cgi',           # 3b
	      make_headers('Authorization' =>
			   'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode("$user:$pass",'')),
	      make_form(OK   => '1', name => 'Sampo'),
	      $mime_type6, $path_to_crt7, $path_to_key8);

B<Case 2c (in SYNOPSIS)> demonstrates getting a password protected page that also requires
a client certificate, i.e. it is possible to use both authentication
methods simultaneously.

B<Case 3b (in SYNOPSIS)> is a full blown POST to a secure server that requires both password
authentication and a client certificate, just like in case 2c.

Note: The client will not send a certificate unless the server requests one.
This is typically achieved by setting the verify mode to C<VERIFY_PEER> on the
server:

  Net::SSLeay::set_verify(ssl, Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_PEER, 0);

See C<perldoc ~openssl/doc/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.pod> for a full description.

=head3 Working through a web proxy

=over

=item * set_proxy

=back

C<Net::SSLeay> can use a web proxy to make its connections. You need to
first set the proxy host and port using C<set_proxy()> and then just
use the normal API functions, e.g:

  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy('gateway.myorg.com', 8080);
  ($page) = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');

If your proxy requires authentication, you can supply a username and
password as well

  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy('gateway.myorg.com', 8080, 'joe', 'salainen');
  ($page, $result, %headers) =
         = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
	      make_headers(Authorization =>
			   'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode("susie:pass",''))
	      );

This example demonstrates the case where we authenticate to the proxy as
C<"joe"> and to the final web server as C<"susie">. Proxy authentication
requires the C<MIME::Base64> module to work.

=head3 HTTP (without S) API

=over

=item * get_http

=item * post_http

=item * tcpcat

=item * get_httpx

=item * post_httpx

=item * tcpxcat

=back

Over the years it has become clear that it would be convenient to use
the light-weight flavour API of C<Net::SSLeay> for normal HTTP as well (see
C<LWP> for the heavy-weight object-oriented approach). In fact it would be
nice to be able to flip https on and off on the fly. Thus regular HTTP
support was evolved.

  use Net::SSLeay qw(get_http post_http tcpcat
                      get_httpx post_httpx tcpxcat
                      make_headers make_form);

  ($page, $result, %headers)
         = get_http('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
	      make_headers(Authorization =>
			   'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode("$user:$pass",''))
	      );

  ($page, $response, %reply_headers)
	 = post_http('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/foo.cgi', '',
		make_form(OK   => '1',
			  name => 'Sampo'
		));

  ($reply, $err) = tcpcat($host, $port, $request);

  ($page, $result, %headers)
         = get_httpx($usessl, 'www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
	      make_headers(Authorization =>
			   'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode("$user:$pass",''))
	      );

  ($page, $response, %reply_headers)
	 = post_httpx($usessl, 'www.bacus.pt', 443, '/foo.cgi', '',
		make_form(OK   => '1',  name => 'Sampo'	));

  ($reply, $err, $server_cert) = tcpxcat($usessl, $host, $port, $request);

As can be seen, the C<"x"> family of APIs takes as the first argument a flag
which indicates whether SSL is used or not.

=head2 Certificate verification and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

OpenSSL supports the ability to verify peer certificates. It can also
optionally check the peer certificate against a Certificate Revocation
List (CRL) from the certificates issuer. A CRL is a file, created by
the certificate issuer that lists all the certificates that it
previously signed, but which it now revokes. CRLs are in PEM format.

You can enable C<Net::SSLeay CRL> checking like this:

	    &Net::SSLeay::X509_STORE_set_flags
		(&Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_cert_store($ssl),
		 &Net::SSLeay::X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK);

After setting this flag, if OpenSSL checks a peer's certificate, then
it will attempt to find a CRL for the issuer. It does this by looking
for a specially named file in the search directory specified by
CTX_load_verify_locations.  CRL files are named with the hash of the
issuer's subject name, followed by C<.r0>, C<.r1> etc.  For example
C<ab1331b2.r0>, C<ab1331b2.r1>. It will read all the .r files for the
issuer, and then check for a revocation of the peer certificate in all
of them.  (You can also force it to look in a specific named CRL
file., see below).  You can find out the hash of the issuer subject
name in a CRL with

	openssl crl -in crl.pem -hash -noout

If the peer certificate does not pass the revocation list, or if no
CRL is found, then the handshaking fails with an error.

You can also force OpenSSL to look for CRLs in one or more arbitrarily
named files.

    my $bio = Net::SSLeay::BIO_new_file($crlfilename, 'r');
    my $crl = Net::SSLeay::PEM_read_bio_X509_CRL($bio);
    if ($crl) {
        Net::SSLeay::X509_STORE_add_crl(
	     Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_cert_store($ssl, $crl)
	);
    } else {
        error reading CRL....
    }

Usually the URLs where you can download the CRLs is contained in the certificate
itself and you can extract them with

    my @url = Net::SSLeay::P_X509_get_crl_distribution_points($cert)

But there is no automatic downloading of the CRLs and often these CRLs are too
huge to just download them to verify a single certificate.
Also, these CRLs are often in DER format which you need to convert to PEM before
you can use it:

    openssl crl -in crl.der -inform der -out crl.pem

So as an alternative for faster and timely revocation checks you better use
the Online Status Revocation Protocol (OCSP).

=head2 Certificate verification and Online Status Revocation Protocol (OCSP)

While checking for revoked certificates is possible and fast with Certificate
Revocation Lists, you need to download the complete and often huge list before
you can verify a single certificate.

A faster way is to ask the CA to check the revocation of just a single or a few
certificates using OCSP. Basically you generate for each certificate an
OCSP_CERTID based on the certificate itself and its issuer, put the ids
togetether into an OCSP_REQUEST and send the request to the URL given in the
certificate.

As a result you get back an OCSP_RESPONSE and need to check the status of the
response, check that it is valid (e.g. signed by the CA) and finally extract the
information about each OCSP_CERTID to find out if the certificate is still valid
or got revoked.

With Net::SSLeay this can be done like this:

    # get id(s) for given certs, like from get_peer_certificate
    # or get_peer_cert_chain. This will croak if
    # - one tries to make an OCSP_CERTID for a self-signed certificate
    # - the issuer of the certificate cannot be found in the SSL objects
    #   store, nor in the current certificate chain
    my $cert = Net::SSLeay::get_peer_certificate($ssl);
    my $id = eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_cert2ids($ssl,$cert) };
    die "failed to make OCSP_CERTID: $@" if $@;

    # create OCSP_REQUEST from id(s)
    # Multiple can be put into the same request, if the same OCSP responder
    # is responsible for them.
    my $req = Net::SSLeay::OCSP_ids2req($id);

    # determine URI of OCSP responder
    my $uri = Net::SSLeay::P_X509_get_ocsp_uri($cert);

    # Send stringified OCSP_REQUEST with POST to $uri.
    # We can ignore certificate verification for https, because the OCSP
    # response itself is signed.
    my $ua = HTTP::Tiny->new(verify_SSL => 0);
    my $res = $ua->request( 'POST',$uri, {
	headers => { 'Content-type' => 'application/ocsp-request' },
	content => Net::SSLeay::i2d_OCSP_REQUEST($req)
    });
    my $content = $res && $res->{success} && $res->{content}
	or die "query failed";

    # Extract OCSP_RESPONSE.
    # this will croak if the string is not an OCSP_RESPONSE
    my $resp = eval { Net::SSLeay::d2i_OCSP_RESPONSE($content) };

    # Check status of response.
    my $status = Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_status($resp);
    if ($status != Net::SSLeay::OCSP_RESPONSE_STATUS_SUCCESSFUL())
	die "OCSP response failed: ".
	    Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_status_str($status);
    }

    # Verify signature of response and if nonce matches request.
    # This will croak if there is a nonce in the response, but it does not match
    # the request. It will return false if the signature could not be verified,
    # in which case details can be retrieved with Net::SSLeay::ERR_get_error.
    # It will not complain if the response does not contain a nonce, which is
    # usually the case with pre-signed responses.
    if ( ! eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_verify($ssl,$resp,$req) }) {
	die "OCSP response verification failed";
    }

    # Extract information from OCSP_RESPONSE for each of the ids.

    # If called in scalar context it will return the time (as time_t), when the
    # next update is due (minimum of all successful responses inside $resp). It
    # will croak on the following problems:
    # - response is expired or not yet valid
    # - no response for given OCSP_CERTID
    # - certificate status is not good (e.g. revoked or unknown)
    if ( my $nextupd = eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_results($resp,$id) }) {
	warn "certificate is valid, next update in ".
	    ($nextupd-time())." seconds\n";
    } else {
	die "certificate is not valid: $@";
    }

    # But in array context it will return detailed information about each given
    # OCSP_CERTID instead croaking on errors:
    # if no @ids are given it will return information about all single responses
    # in the OCSP_RESPONSE
    my @results = Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_results($resp,@ids);
    for my $r (@results) {
	print Dumper($r);
	# @results are in the same order as the @ids and contain:
	# $r->[0] - OCSP_CERTID
	# $r->[1] - undef if no error (certificate good) OR error message as string
	# $r->[2] - hash with details:
	#   thisUpdate - time_t of this single response
	#   nextUpdate - time_t when update is expected
	#   statusType - integer:
	#      V_OCSP_CERTSTATUS_GOOD(0)
	#      V_OCSP_CERTSTATUS_REVOKED(1)
	#      V_OCSP_CERTSTATUS_UNKNOWN(2)
	#   revocationTime - time_t (only if revoked)
	#   revocationReason - integer (only if revoked)
	#   revocationReason_str - reason as string (only if revoked)
    }

To further speed up certificate revocation checking one can use a TLS extension
to instruct the server to staple the OCSP response:

    # set TLS extension before doing SSL_connect
    Net::SSLeay::set_tlsext_status_type($ssl,
	Net::SSLeay::TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp());

    # setup callback to verify OCSP response
    my $cert_valid = undef;
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb($context,sub {
	my ($ssl,$resp) = @_;
	if (!$resp) {
	    # Lots of servers don't return an OCSP response.
	    # In this case we must check the OCSP status outside the SSL
	    # handshake.
	    warn "server did not return stapled OCSP response\n";
	    return 1;
	}
	# verify status
	my $status = Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_status($resp);
	if ($status != Net::SSLeay::OCSP_RESPONSE_STATUS_SUCCESSFUL()) {
	    warn "OCSP response failure: $status\n";
	    return 1;
	}
	# verify signature - we have no OCSP_REQUEST here to check nonce
	if (!eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_verify($ssl,$resp) }) {
	    warn "OCSP response verify failed\n";
	    return 1;
	}
	# check if the certificate is valid
	# we should check here against the peer_certificate
	my $cert = Net::SSLeay::get_peer_certificate();
	my $certid = eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_cert2ids($ssl,$cert) } or do {
	    warn "cannot get certid from cert: $@";
	    $cert_valid = -1;
	    return 1;
	};

	if ( $nextupd = eval {
	    Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_results($resp,$certid) }) {
	    warn "certificate not revoked\n";
	    $cert_valid = 1;
	} else {
	    warn "certificate not valid: $@";
	    $cert_valid = 0;
	}
    });

    # do SSL handshake here
    ....
    # check if certificate revocation was checked already
    if ( ! defined $cert_valid) {
	# check revocation outside of SSL handshake by asking OCSP responder
	...
    } elsif ( ! $cert_valid ) {
	die "certificate not valid - closing SSL connection";
    } elsif ( $cert_valid<0 ) {
	die "cannot verify certificate revocation - self-signed ?";
    } else {
	# everything fine
	...
    }


=head2 Using Net::SSLeay in multi-threaded applications

B<IMPORTANT: versions 1.42 or earlier are not thread-safe!>

Net::SSLeay module implements all necessary stuff to be ready for multi-threaded
environment - it requires openssl-0.9.7 or newer. The implementation fully follows thread safety related requirements
of openssl library(see L<http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html|http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html>).

If you are about to use Net::SSLeay (or any other module based on Net::SSLeay) in multi-threaded
perl application it is recommended to follow this best-practice:

=head3 Initialization

Load and initialize Net::SSLeay module in the main thread:

    use threads;
    use Net::SSLeay;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    sub do_master_job {
      #... call whatever from Net::SSLeay
    }

    sub do_worker_job {
      #... call whatever from Net::SSLeay
    }

    #start threads
    my $master  = threads->new(\&do_master_job, 'param1', 'param2');
    my @workers = threads->new(\&do_worker_job, 'arg1', 'arg2') for (1..10);

    #waiting for all threads to finish
    $_->join() for (threads->list);

NOTE: Openssl's C<int SSL_library_init(void)> function (which is also aliased as
C<SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms>, C<OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms> and C<add_ssl_algorithms>)
is not re-entrant and multiple calls can cause a crash in threaded application.
Net::SSLeay implements flags preventing repeated calls to this function,
therefore even multiple initialization via Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms()
should work without trouble.

=head3 Using callbacks

Do not use callbacks across threads (the module blocks cross-thread callback operations
and throws a warning). Always do the callback setup, callback use and callback destruction
within the same thread.

=head3 Using openssl elements

All openssl elements (X509, SSL_CTX, ...) can be directly passed between threads.

    use threads;
    use Net::SSLeay;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    sub do_job {
      Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($context, sub { "secret" });
      #...
    }

    $context = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new();
    threads->create(\&do_job);


=head3 Using other perl modules based on Net::SSLeay

It should be fine to use any other module based on L<Net::SSLeay> (like L<IO::Socket::SSL>)
in multi-threaded applications. It is generally recommended to do any global initialization
of such a module in the main thread before calling C<< threads->new(..) >> or
C<< threads->create(..) >> but it might differ module by module.

To be safe you can load and init Net::SSLeay explicitly in the main thread:

    use Net::SSLeay;
    use Other::SSLeay::Based::Module;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

Or even safer:

    use Net::SSLeay;
    use Other::SSLeay::Based::Module;

    BEGIN {
      Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
      Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
      Net::SSLeay::randomize();
    }

=head3 Combining Net::SSLeay with other modules linked with openssl

B<BEWARE: This might be a big trouble! This is not guaranteed be thread-safe!>

There are many other (XS) modules linked directly to openssl library (like L<Crypt::SSLeay>).

As it is expected that also "another" module will call C<SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms> at some point
we have again a trouble with multiple openssl initialization by Net::SSLeay and "another" module.

As you can expect Net::SSLeay is not able to avoid multiple initialization of openssl library
called by "another" module, thus you have to handle this on your own (in some cases it might
not be possible at all to avoid this).

=head3 Threading with get_https and friends

The convenience functions get_https, post_https etc all initialize the SSL library by calling
Net::SSLeay::initialize which does the conventional library initialization:

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

Net::SSLeay::initialize initializes the SSL library at most once.
You can override the Net::SSLeay::initialize function if you desire
some other type of initialization behaviour by get_https and friends.
You can call Net::SSLeay::initialize from your own code if you desire this conventional library initialization.

=head2 Convenience routines

To be used with Low level API

    Net::SSLeay::randomize($rn_seed_file,$additional_seed);
    Net::SSLeay::set_cert_and_key($ctx, $cert_path, $key_path);
    $cert = Net::SSLeay::dump_peer_certificate($ssl);
    Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, $message) or die "ssl write failure";
    $got = Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all($ssl) or die "ssl read failure";

    $got = Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_CRLF($ssl [, $max_length]);
    $got = Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_until($ssl [, $delimit [, $max_length]]);
    Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_CRLF($ssl, $message);

=over

=item * randomize

seeds the openssl PRNG with C</dev/urandom> (see the top of C<SSLeay.pm>
for how to change or configure this) and optionally with user provided
data. It is very important to properly seed your random numbers, so
do not forget to call this. The high level API functions automatically
call C<randomize()> so it is not needed with them. See also caveats.

=item * set_cert_and_key

takes two file names as arguments and sets
the certificate and private key to those. This can be used to
set either server certificates or client certificates.

=item * dump_peer_certificate

allows you to get a plaintext description of the
certificate the peer (usually the server) presented to us.

=item * ssl_read_all

see ssl_write_all (below)

=item * ssl_write_all

C<ssl_read_all()> and C<ssl_write_all()> provide true blocking semantics for
these operations (see limitation, below, for explanation). These are
much preferred to the low level API equivalents (which implement BSD
blocking semantics). The message argument to C<ssl_write_all()> can be
a reference. This is helpful to avoid unnecessary copying when writing
something big, e.g:

    $data = 'A' x 1000000000;
    Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, \$data) or die "ssl write failed";

=item * ssl_read_CRLF

uses C<ssl_read_all()> to read in a line terminated with a
carriage return followed by a linefeed (CRLF).  The CRLF is included in
the returned scalar.

=item * ssl_read_until

uses C<ssl_read_all()> to read from the SSL input
stream until it encounters a programmer specified delimiter.
If the delimiter is undefined, C<$/> is used.  If C<$/> is undefined,
C<\n> is used.  One can optionally set a maximum length of bytes to read
from the SSL input stream.

=item * ssl_write_CRLF

writes C<$message> and appends CRLF to the SSL output stream.

=back

=head2 Initialization

In order to use the low level API you should start your programs with
the following incantation:

	use Net::SSLeay qw(die_now die_if_ssl_error);
	Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
	Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();    # Important!
        Net::SSLeay::ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();  # If you want built-in engines
        Net::SSLeay::ENGINE_register_all_complete(); # If you want built-in engines
        Net::SSLeay::randomize();

=head2 Error handling functions

I can not emphasize the need to check for error enough. Use these
functions even in the most simple programs, they will reduce debugging
time greatly. Do not ask questions on the mailing list without having
first sprinkled these in your code.

=over

=item * die_now

=item * die_if_ssl_error

C<die_now()> and C<die_if_ssl_error()> are used to conveniently print the SSLeay error
stack when something goes wrong:

	Net::SSLeay::connect($ssl) or die_now("Failed SSL connect ($!)");


	Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, "foo") or die_if_ssl_error("SSL write ($!)");

=item * print_errs

You can also use C<Net::SSLeay::print_errs()> to dump the error stack without
exiting the program. As can be seen, your code becomes much more readable
if you import the error reporting functions into your main name space.

=back

=head2 Sockets

Perl uses file handles for all I/O. While SSLeay has a quite flexible BIO
mechanism and perl has an evolved PerlIO mechanism, this module still
sticks to using file descriptors. Thus to attach SSLeay to a socket you
should use C<fileno()> to extract the underlying file descriptor:

    Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno(S));   # Must use fileno

You should also set C<$|> to 1 to eliminate STDIO buffering so you do not
get confused if you use perl I/O functions to manipulate your socket
handle.

If you need to C<select(2)> on the socket, go right ahead, but be warned
that OpenSSL does some internal buffering so SSL_read does not always
return data even if the socket selected for reading (just keep on
selecting and trying to read). C<Net::SSLeay> is no different from the
C language OpenSSL in this respect.

=head2 Callbacks

You can establish a per-context verify callback function something like this:

	sub verify {
	    my ($ok, $x509_store_ctx) = @_;
	    print "Verifying certificate...\n";
		...
	    return $ok;
	}

It is used like this:

	Net::SSLeay::set_verify ($ssl, Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_PEER, \&verify);

Per-context callbacks for decrypting private keys are implemented.

        Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($ctx, sub { "top-secret" });
        Net::SSLeay::CTX_use_PrivateKey_file($ctx, "key.pem",
					     Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM)
            or die "Error reading private key";
        Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($ctx, undef);

If Hello Extensions are supported by your OpenSSL,
a session secret callback can be set up to be called when a session secret is set
by openssl.

Establish it like this:
    Net::SSLeay::set_session_secret_cb($ssl, \&session_secret_cb, $somedata);

It will be called like this:

    sub session_secret_cb
    {
        my ($secret, \@cipherlist, \$preferredcipher, $somedata) = @_;
    }


No other callbacks are implemented. You do not need to use any
callback for simple (i.e. normal) cases where the SSLeay built-in
verify mechanism satisfies your needs.

It is required to reset these callbacks to undef immediately after use to prevent
memory leaks, thread safety problems and crashes on exit that
can occur if different threads set different callbacks.

If you want to use callback stuff, see examples/callback.pl! It's the
only one I am able to make work reliably.

=head2 Low level API

In addition to the high level functions outlined above, this module
contains straight-forward access to CRYPTO and SSL parts of OpenSSL C API.

See the C<*.h> headers from OpenSSL C distribution for a list of low level
SSLeay functions to call (check SSLeay.xs to see if some function has been
implemented). The module strips the initial C<"SSL_"> off of the SSLeay names.
Generally you should use C<Net::SSLeay::> in its place.

Note that some functions are prefixed with C<"P_"> - these are very close to
the original API however contain some kind of a wrapper making its interface
more perl friendly.

For example:

In C:

	#include <ssl.h>

	err = SSL_set_verify (ssl, SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
				   &your_call_back_here);

In Perl:

	use Net::SSLeay;

	$err = Net::SSLeay::set_verify ($ssl,
					Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
					\&your_call_back_here);

If the function does not start with C<SSL_> you should use the full
function name, e.g.:

	$err = Net::SSLeay::ERR_get_error;

The following new functions behave in perlish way:

	$got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
                                    # Performs SSL_read, but returns $got
                                    # resized according to data received.
                                    # Returns undef on failure.

	Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, $foo) || die;
                                    # Performs SSL_write, but automatically
                                    # figures out the size of $foo

=item * set_session_secret_cb

Setup pre-shared secret session resumption function.

 Net::SSLeay::set_session_secret_cb($ssl, $func, $data);
 # $ssl - value corresponding to openssl's SSL structure
 # $func - perl reference to callback function
 # $data - [optional] data that will be passed to callback function when invoked
 #
 # returns: no return value

The callback function will be called like:
callback_function($secret, $ciphers, $pref_cipher, $data);

# $secret is the current master session key, usually all 0s at the beginning of a session
# $ciphers is ref to an array of peer cipher names
# $pref_cipher is a ref to an index into the list of cipher names of 
#  the preferred cipher. Set it if you want to specify a preferred cipher
# $data is the data passed to set_session_secret_cb

The callback function should return 1 if it likes the suggested cipher (or has selected an alternative 
by setting pref_cipher), else it should return 0 (in which case OpenSSL will select its own preferred cipher).

With OpenSSL 1.1 and later, callback_function can change the master key for the session by 
altering $secret and returning 1.

=item * CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_getkey_cb

Setup encryption for TLS session tickets (stateless session reuse).

 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_getkey_cb($ctx, $func, $data);
 # $ctx  - value corresponding to openssl's SSL_CTX structure
 # $func - perl reference to callback function
 # $data - [optional] data that will be passed to callback function when invoked
 #
 # returns: no return value

The callback function will be called like:
getkey($data,[$key_name]) -> ($key,$current_key_name)

# $data is the data passed to set_session_secret_cb
# $key_name is the name of the key OpenSSL has extracted from the session ticket
# $key is the requested key for ticket encryption + HMAC
# $current_key_name is the name for the currently valid key

OpenSSL will call the function without a key name if it generates a new ticket.
It then needs the callback to return the encryption+HMAC key and an identifier
(key name) for this key.

When OpenSSL gets a session ticket from the client it extracts the key name and
calls the callback with this name as argument. It then expects the callback to
return the encryption+HMAC key matching the requested key name and and also the
key name which should be used at the moment. If the requested key name and the
returned key name differ it means that this session ticket was created with an
expired key and need to be renewed. In this case OpenSSL will call the callback
again with no key name to create a new session ticket based on the old one.

The key must be at least 32 byte of random data which can be created with
RAND_bytes. Internally the first 16 byte are used as key in AES-128 encryption
while the next 16 byte are used for the SHA-256 HMAC.
The key name are binary data and must be exactly 16 byte long. 

Example:

    Net::SSLeay::RAND_bytes(my $oldkey,32);
    Net::SSLeay::RAND_bytes(my $newkey,32);
    my $oldkey_name = pack("a16",'oldsecret');
    my $newkey_name = pack("a16",'newsecret');

    my @keys = (
	[ $newkey_name, $newkey ], # current active key
	[ $oldkey_name, $oldkey ], # already expired
    );

    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_getkey_cb($server2->_ctx, sub {
	my ($mykeys,$name) = @_;

	# return (current_key, current_key_name) if no name given
	return ($mykeys->[0][1],$mykeys->[0][0]) if ! $name;

	# return (matching_key, current_key_name) if we find a key matching
	# the given name
	for(my $i = 0; $i<@$mykeys; $i++) {
	    next if $name ne $mykeys->[$i][0];
	    return ($mykeys->[$i][1],$mykeys->[0][0]);
	}

	# no matching key found
	return;
    },\@keys);

  my $result = Net::SSLeay::EVP_DigestFinal($ctx);
  Net::SSLeay::EVP_MD_CTX_destroy($ctx);

  print "digest=", unpack('H*', $result), "\n"; #print hex value

Sets up digest context $ctx to use a digest $type from ENGINE $impl, $ctx must be
initialized before calling this function, type will typically be supplied by a function
such as L</EVP_get_digestbyname>. If $impl is 0 then the default implementation of digest $type is used.

=item * CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback

B<COMPATIBILITY:> requires at least OpenSSL 0.9.8f

This function is used in a server to support Server side Server Name Indication (SNI).

 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback($ctx, $code)
 # $ctx - SSL context
 # $code - reference to a subroutine that will be called when a new connection is being initiated
 #
 # returns: no return value
On the client side:
use set_tlsext_host_name($ssl, $servername) before initiating the SSL connection.

On the server side:
Set up an additional SSL_CTX() for each different certificate;

Add a servername callback to each SSL_CTX() using CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback();

The callback function is required to retrieve the client-supplied servername
with get_servername(ssl). Figure out the right
SSL_CTX to go with that host name, then switch the SSL object to that SSL_CTX
with set_SSL_CTX().

Example:

 # set callback
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback($ctx, 
    sub {
      my $ssl = shift;
      my $h = Net::SSLeay::get_servername($ssl);
      Net::SSLeay::set_SSL_CTX($ssl, $hostnames{$h}->{ctx}) if exists $hostnames{$h};
    } );


More complete example:

 # ... initialize Net::SSLeay

 my %hostnames = (
   'sni1' => { cert=>'sni1.pem', key=>'sni1.key' },
   'sni2' => { cert=>'sni2.pem', key=>'sni2.key' },
 );

 # create a new context for each certificate/key pair
 for my $name (keys %hostnames) {
   $hostnames{$name}->{ctx} = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new or die;
   Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_cipher_list($hostnames{$name}->{ctx}, 'ALL');
   Net::SSLeay::set_cert_and_key($hostnames{$name}->{ctx},

=head3 Low level API: NPN (next protocol negotiation) related functions

NPN is being replaced with ALPN, a more recent TLS extension for application
protocol negotiation that's in process of being adopted by IETF. Please look
below for APLN API description.

Simple approach for using NPN support looks like this:

 ### client side
 use Net::SSLeay;
 use IO::Socket::INET;

 Net::SSLeay::initialize();
 my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr=>'encrypted.google.com:443') or die;
 my $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_tlsv1_new() or die;
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL);
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb($ctx, ['http1.1','spdy/2']);
 my $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx) or die;
 Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno($sock)) or die;
 Net::SSLeay::connect($ssl);

 warn "client:negotiated=",Net::SSLeay::P_next_proto_negotiated($ssl), "\n";
 warn "client:last_status=", Net::SSLeay::P_next_proto_last_status($ssl), "\n";
 
 ### server side 
 use Net::SSLeay;
 use IO::Socket::INET;
 
 Net::SSLeay::initialize();
 my $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_tlsv1_new() or die;
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL);
 Net::SSLeay::set_cert_and_key($ctx, "t/data/cert.pem", "t/data/key.pem");
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_next_protos_advertised_cb($ctx, ['spdy/2','http1.1']);
 my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(LocalAddr=>'localhost', LocalPort=>5443, Proto=>'tcp', Listen=>20) or die;
 
 while (1) {
   my $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx);
   warn("server:waiting for incoming connection...\n");
   my $fd = $sock->accept();
   Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, $fd->fileno);
   Net::SSLeay::accept($ssl);  
   warn "server:negotiated=",Net::SSLeay::P_next_proto_negotiated($ssl),"\n";
   my $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
   Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, "length=".length($got));
   Net::SSLeay::free($ssl);
   $fd->close();
 }
 # check with: openssl s_client -connect localhost:5443 -nextprotoneg http/1.1,spdy/2

Please note that the selection (negotiation) is performed by client side, the server side simply advertise the list of supported protocols.

Advanced approach allows you to implement your own negotiation algorithm.

 #see below documentation for:
 Net::SSleay::CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb($ctx, $perl_callback_function, $callback_data);
 Net::SSleay::CTX_set_next_protos_advertised_cb($ctx, $perl_callback_function, $callback_data);

Detection of NPN support (works even in older Net::SSLeay versions):

 use Net::SSLeay;
 
 if (exists &Net::SSLeay::P_next_proto_negotiated) {
   # do NPN stuff
 }

=head3 Low level API: ALPN (application layer protocol negotiation) related functions

Application protocol can be negotiated via two different mechanisms employing
two different TLS extensions: NPN (obsolete) and ALPN (recommended).

The API is rather similar, with slight differences reflecting protocol
specifics. In particular, with ALPN the protocol negotiation takes place on
server, while with NPN the client implements the protocol negotiation logic.

With ALPN, the most basic implementation looks like this:

 ### client side
 use Net::SSLeay;
 use IO::Socket::INET;

 Net::SSLeay::initialize();
 my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr=>'encrypted.google.com:443') or die;
 my $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_tlsv1_new() or die;
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL);
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_alpn_protos($ctx, ['http/1.1', 'http/2.0', 'spdy/3]);
 my $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx) or die;
 Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno($sock)) or die;
 Net::SSLeay::connect($ssl);

 warn "client:selected=",Net::SSLeay::P_alpn_selected($ssl), "\n";

 ### server side
 use Net::SSLeay;
 use IO::Socket::INET;

 Net::SSLeay::initialize();
 my $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_tlsv1_new() or die;
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL);
 Net::SSLeay::set_cert_and_key($ctx, "t/data/cert.pem", "t/data/key.pem");
 Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_alpn_select_cb($ctx, ['http/1.1', 'http/2.0', 'spdy/3]);
 my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(LocalAddr=>'localhost', LocalPort=>5443, Proto=>'tcp', Listen=>20) or die;

 while (1) {
   my $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx);
   warn("server:waiting for incoming connection...\n");
   my $fd = $sock->accept();
   Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, $fd->fileno);
   Net::SSLeay::accept($ssl);
   warn "server:selected=",Net::SSLeay::P_alpn_selected($ssl),"\n";
   my $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
   Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, "length=".length($got));
   Net::SSLeay::free($ssl);
   $fd->close();
 }
 # check with: openssl s_client -connect localhost:5443 -alpn spdy/3,http/1.1

Advanced approach allows you to implement your own negotiation algorithm.

 #see below documentation for:
 Net::SSleay::CTX_set_alpn_select_cb($ctx, $perl_callback_function, $callback_data);

Detection of ALPN support (works even in older Net::SSLeay versions):

 use Net::SSLeay;

 if (exists &Net::SSLeay::P_alpn_selected) {
   # do ALPN stuff
 }

=item * CTX_set_alpn_select_cb

B<COMPATIBILITY:> not available in Net-SSLeay-1.55 and before; requires at least openssl-1.0.2

B<NOTE:> You need CTX_set_alpn_select_cb on B<server side> of TLS connection.

Simple usage - in this case a "common" negotiation algorithm (as implemented by openssl's function SSL_select_next_proto) is used.

 $rv = Net::SSleay::CTX_set_alpn_select_cb($ctx, $arrayref);
 # $ctx - value corresponding to openssl's SSL_CTX structure
 # $arrayref - list of accepted protocols - e.g. ['http/2.0', 'http/1.1', 'spdy/3']
 #
 # returns: 0 on success, 1 on failure

Advanced usage (you probably do not need this):

 $rv = Net::SSleay::CTX_set_alpn_select_cb($ctx, $perl_callback_function, $callback_data);
 # $ctx - value corresponding to openssl's SSL_CTX structure
 # $perl_callback_function - reference to perl function
 # $callback_data - [optional] data to passed to callback function when invoked
 #
 # returns: 0 on success, 1 on failure

 # where callback function looks like
 sub alpn_select_cb_invoke {
   my ($ssl, $arrayref_proto_list_advertised_by_client, $callback_data) = @_;
   # ...
   if ($negotiated) {
     return 'http/2.0';
   } else {
     return undef;
   }
 }

To undefine/clear this callback use:

 Net::SSleay::CTX_set_alpn_select_cb($ctx, undef);

=item * set_alpn_protos

This adds list of supported application layer protocols to ClientHello message sent by a client.
It advertises the enumeration of supported protocols:

 Net::SSLeay::set_alpn_protos($ssl, ['http/1.1', 'http/2.0', 'spdy/3]);

=head3 Low level API: DANE Support

OpenSSL version 1.0.2 adds preliminary support RFC6698 Domain Authentication of
Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Association within OpenSSL

=over 

=item * SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname

B<COMPATIBILITY:> DELETED from net-ssleay, since it is not supported by OpenSSL

In order to facilitate DANE there is additional interface,
SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname, accepting hostname, port and socket type
that returns packed TLSA record. In order to make it even easier there
is additional SSL_ctrl function that calls SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname
for you. Latter is recommended for programmers that wish to maintain
broader binary compatibility, e.g. make application work with both 1.0.2
and prior version (in which case call to SSL_ctrl with new code
returning error would have to be ignored when running with prior version).

Net::SSLeay::get_tlsa_record_byname($name, $port, $type);

 #       193 to 255: reserved for private use
 #
 # $cm - value corresponding to openssl's COMP_METHOD structure
 #
 # returns: 0 on success, 1 on failure (check the error queue to find out the reason)

=item * EC_KEY_generate_key

Generates a EC key and returns it in a newly allocated EC_KEY structure.
The EC key then can be used to create a PKEY which can be used in calls
like X509_set_pubkey.

 my $key = Net::SSLeay::EVP_PKEY_new();
 my $ec  = Net::SSLeay::EC_KEY_generate_key($curve);
 Net::SSLeay::EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY($key,$ec);

 # $curve - curve name like 'secp521r1' or the matching Id (integer) of the curve
 #
 # returns: value corresponding to openssl's EC_KEY structure (0 on failure)

This function has no equivalent in OpenSSL but combines multiple OpenSSL
functions for an easier interface.

=head2 Constants

There are many openssl constants available in L<Net::SSLeay>. You can use them like this:

 use Net::SSLeay;
 print &Net::SSLeay::NID_commonName;
 #or
 print Net::SSLeay::NID_commonName();

Or you can import them and use:

 use Net::SSLeay qw/NID_commonName/;
 print &NID_commonName;
 #or
 print NID_commonName();
 #or
 print NID_commonName;

The constants names are derived from openssl constants, however constants starting with C<SSL_> prefix
have name with C<SSL_> part stripped - e.g. openssl's constant C<SSL_OP_ALL> is available as C<Net::SSleay::OP_ALL>

=head1 EXAMPLES

One very good example to look at is the implementation of C<sslcat()> in the
C<SSLeay.pm> file.

The following is a simple SSLeay client (with too little error checking :-(

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Socket;
    use Net::SSLeay qw(die_now die_if_ssl_error) ;
    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    ($dest_serv, $port, $msg) = @ARGV;      # Read command line
    $port = getservbyname ($port, 'tcp') unless $port =~ /^\d+$/;
    $dest_ip = gethostbyname ($dest_serv);
    $dest_serv_params  = sockaddr_in($port, $dest_ip);

    socket  (S, &AF_INET, &SOCK_STREAM, 0)  or die "socket: $!";
    connect (S, $dest_serv_params)          or die "connect: $!";
    select  (S); $| = 1; select (STDOUT);   # Eliminate STDIO buffering

    # The network connection is now open, lets fire up SSL

    $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new() or die_now("Failed to create SSL_CTX $!");
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
         or die_if_ssl_error("ssl ctx set options");
    $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx) or die_now("Failed to create SSL $!");
    Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno(S));   # Must use fileno
    $res = Net::SSLeay::connect($ssl) and die_if_ssl_error("ssl connect");
    print "Cipher `" . Net::SSLeay::get_cipher($ssl) . "'\n";

    # Exchange data

    $res = Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, $msg);  # Perl knows how long $msg is
    die_if_ssl_error("ssl write");
    CORE::shutdown S, 1;  # Half close --> No more output, sends EOF to server
    $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);         # Perl returns undef on failure
    die_if_ssl_error("ssl read");
    print $got;

    Net::SSLeay::free ($ssl);               # Tear down connection
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_free ($ctx);
    close S;

The following is a simple SSLeay echo server (non forking):

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Socket;
    use Net::SSLeay qw(die_now die_if_ssl_error);
    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    $our_ip = "\0\0\0\0"; # Bind to all interfaces
    $port = 1235;
    $sockaddr_template = 'S n a4 x8';
    $our_serv_params = pack ($sockaddr_template, &AF_INET, $port, $our_ip);

    socket (S, &AF_INET, &SOCK_STREAM, 0)  or die "socket: $!";
    bind (S, $our_serv_params)             or die "bind:   $!";
    listen (S, 5)                          or die "listen: $!";
    $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new ()         or die_now("CTX_new ($ctx): $!");
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
         or die_if_ssl_error("ssl ctx set options");

    # Following will ask password unless private key is not encrypted
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_use_RSAPrivateKey_file ($ctx, 'plain-rsa.pem',
                                             &Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM);
    die_if_ssl_error("private key");
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_use_certificate_file ($ctx, 'plain-cert.pem',
 				           &Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM);
    die_if_ssl_error("certificate");

    while (1) {
        print "Accepting connections...\n";
        ($addr = accept (NS, S))           or die "accept: $!";
        select (NS); $| = 1; select (STDOUT);  # Piping hot!

        ($af,$client_port,$client_ip) = unpack($sockaddr_template,$addr);
        @inetaddr = unpack('C4',$client_ip);
        print "$af connection from " .
        join ('.', @inetaddr) . ":$client_port\n";

        # We now have a network connection, lets fire up SSLeay...

        $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx)      or die_now("SSL_new ($ssl): $!");
        Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno(NS));

        $err = Net::SSLeay::accept($ssl) and die_if_ssl_error('ssl accept');
        print "Cipher `" . Net::SSLeay::get_cipher($ssl) . "'\n";

        # Connected. Exchange some data.

        $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);     # Returns undef on fail
        die_if_ssl_error("ssl read");
        print "Got `$got' (" . length ($got) . " chars)\n";

        Net::SSLeay::write ($ssl, uc ($got)) or die "write: $!";
        die_if_ssl_error("ssl write");

        Net::SSLeay::free ($ssl);           # Tear down connection
        close NS;
    }

Yet another echo server. This one runs from C</etc/inetd.conf> so it avoids
all the socket code overhead. Only caveat is opening an rsa key file -
it had better be without any encryption or else it will not know where
to ask for the password. Note how C<STDIN> and C<STDOUT> are wired to SSL.

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # /etc/inetd.conf
    #    ssltst stream tcp nowait root /path/to/server.pl server.pl
    # /etc/services
    #    ssltst		1234/tcp

    use Net::SSLeay qw(die_now die_if_ssl_error);
    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    chdir '/key/dir' or die "chdir: $!";
    $| = 1;  # Piping hot!
    open LOG, ">>/dev/console" or die "Can't open log file $!";
    select LOG; print "server.pl started\n";

    $ctx = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new()     or die_now "CTX_new ($ctx) ($!)";
    $ssl = Net::SSLeay::new($ctx)     or die_now "new ($ssl) ($!)";
    Net::SSLeay::set_options($ssl, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
         and die_if_ssl_error("ssl set options");

    # We get already open network connection from inetd, now we just
    # need to attach SSLeay to STDIN and STDOUT
    Net::SSLeay::set_rfd($ssl, fileno(STDIN));
    Net::SSLeay::set_wfd($ssl, fileno(STDOUT));

    Net::SSLeay::use_RSAPrivateKey_file ($ssl, 'plain-rsa.pem',
                                         Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM);
    die_if_ssl_error("private key");
    Net::SSLeay::use_certificate_file ($ssl, 'plain-cert.pem',
                                       Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM);
    die_if_ssl_error("certificate");

    Net::SSLeay::accept($ssl) and die_if_ssl_err("ssl accept: $!");
    print "Cipher `" . Net::SSLeay::get_cipher($ssl) . "'\n";

    $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
    die_if_ssl_error("ssl read");
    print "Got `$got' (" . length ($got) . " chars)\n";

    Net::SSLeay::write ($ssl, uc($got)) or die "write: $!";
    die_if_ssl_error("ssl write");

    Net::SSLeay::free ($ssl);         # Tear down the connection
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_free ($ctx);
    close LOG;

There are also a number of example/test programs in the examples directory:

    sslecho.pl   -  A simple server, not unlike the one above
    minicli.pl   -  Implements a client using low level SSLeay routines
    sslcat.pl    -  Demonstrates using high level sslcat utility function
    get_page.pl  -  Is a utility for getting html pages from secure servers
    callback.pl  -  Demonstrates certificate verification and callback usage
    stdio_bulk.pl       - Does SSL over Unix pipes
    ssl-inetd-serv.pl   - SSL server that can be invoked from inetd.conf
    httpd-proxy-snif.pl - Utility that allows you to see how a browser
                          sends https request to given server and what reply
                          it gets back (very educative :-)
    makecert.pl  -  Creates a self signed cert (does not use this module)

=head1 INSTALLATION

See README and README.* in the distribution directory for installation guidance on a variety of platforms.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

C<Net::SSLeay::read()> uses an internal buffer of 32KB, thus no single read
will return more. In practice one read returns much less, usually
as much as fits in one network packet. To work around this,
you should use a loop like this:

    $reply = '';
    while ($got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl)) {
        last if print_errs('SSL_read');
        $reply .= $got;
    }

Although there is no built-in limit in C<Net::SSLeay::write()>, the network
packet size limitation applies here as well, thus use:

    $written = 0;

    while ($written < length($message)) {
        $written += Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, substr($message, $written));
        last if print_errs('SSL_write');
    }

Or alternatively you can just use the following convenience functions:

    Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, $message) or die "ssl write failure";
    $got = Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all($ssl) or die "ssl read failure";

=head1 KNOWN BUGS AND CAVEATS

An OpenSSL bug CVE-2015-0290 "OpenSSL Multiblock Corrupted Pointer Issue" 
can cause POST requests of over 90kB to fail or crash. This bug is reported to be fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2a.

Autoloader emits a

    Argument "xxx" isn't numeric in entersub at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm'

warning if die_if_ssl_error is made autoloadable. If you figure out why,
drop me a line.

Callback set using C<SSL_set_verify()> does not appear to work. This may
well be an openssl problem (e.g. see C<ssl/ssl_lib.c> line 1029). Try using
C<SSL_CTX_set_verify()> instead and do not be surprised if even this stops
working in future versions.

Callback and certificate verification stuff is generally too little tested.

Random numbers are not initialized randomly enough, especially if you
do not have C</dev/random> and/or C</dev/urandom> (such as in Solaris
platforms - but it's been suggested that cryptorand daemon from the SUNski
package solves this). In this case you should investigate third party
software that can emulate these devices, e.g. by way of a named pipe
to some program.

Another gotcha with random number initialization is randomness
depletion. This phenomenon, which has been extensively discussed in
OpenSSL, Apache-SSL, and Apache-mod_ssl forums, can cause your
script to block if you use C</dev/random> or to operate insecurely
if you use C</dev/urandom>. What happens is that when too much
randomness is drawn from the operating system's randomness pool
then randomness can temporarily be unavailable. C</dev/random> solves
this problem by waiting until enough randomness can be gathered - and
this can take a long time since blocking reduces activity in the
machine and less activity provides less random events: a vicious circle.
C</dev/urandom> solves this dilemma more pragmatically by simply returning
predictable "random" numbers. SomeC< /dev/urandom> emulation software
however actually seems to implement C</dev/random> semantics. Caveat emptor.

I've been pointed to two such daemons by Mik Firestone <mik@@speed.stdio._com>
who has used them on Solaris 8:

If you are using the low level API functions to communicate with other
SSL implementations, you would do well to call

    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
         or die_if_ssl_error("ssl ctx set options");

to cope with some well know bugs in some other SSL
implementations. The high level API functions always set all known
compatibility options.

Sometimes C<sslcat()> (and the high level HTTPS functions that build on it)
is too fast in signaling the EOF to legacy HTTPS servers. This causes
the server to return empty page. To work around this problem you can
set the global variable

    $Net::SSLeay::slowly = 1;   # Add sleep so broken servers can keep up

HTTP/1.1 is not supported. Specifically this module does not know to
issue or serve multiple http requests per connection. This is a serious
shortcoming, but using the SSL session cache on your server helps to
alleviate the CPU load somewhat.

As of version 1.09 many newer OpenSSL auxiliary functions were
added (from C<REM_AUTOMATICALLY_GENERATED_1_09> onwards in C<SSLeay.xs>).
Unfortunately I have not had any opportunity to test these. Some of
them are trivial enough that I believe they "just work", but others
have rather complex interfaces with function pointers and all. In these
cases you should proceed wit great caution.

This module defaults to using OpenSSL automatic protocol negotiation
code for automatically detecting the version of the SSL protocol
that the other end talks. With most web servers this works just
fine, but once in a while I get complaints from people that the module
does not work with some web servers. Usually this can be solved
by explicitly setting the protocol version, e.g.

   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 2;  # Insist on SSLv2
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 3;  # Insist on SSLv3
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 10; # Insist on TLSv1

Although the autonegotiation is nice to have, the SSL standards
do not formally specify any such mechanism. Most of the world has
accepted the SSLeay/OpenSSL way of doing it as the de facto standard. But
for the few that think differently, you have to explicitly speak
the correct version. This is not really a bug, but rather a deficiency
in the standards. If a site refuses to respond or sends back some
nonsensical error codes (at the SSL handshake level), try this option
before mailing me.

On some systems, OpenSSL may be compiled without support for SSLv2.
If this is the case, Net::SSLeay will warn if ssl_version has been set
to 2.

The high level API returns the certificate of the peer, thus allowing
one to check what certificate was supplied. However, you will only be
able to check the certificate after the fact, i.e. you already sent
your form data by the time you find out that you did not trust them,
oops.

So, while being able to know the certificate after the fact is surely
useful, the security minded would still choose to do the connection
and certificate verification first and only then exchange data
with the site. Currently none of the high level API functions do
this, thus you would have to program it using the low level API. A
good place to start is to see how the C<Net::SSLeay::http_cat()> function
is implemented.

The high level API functions use a global file handle C<SSLCAT_S>
internally. This really should not be a problem because there is no
way to interleave the high level API functions, unless you use threads
(but threads are not very well supported in perl anyway (as of version
5.6.1). However, you may run into problems if you call undocumented
internal functions in an interleaved fashion. The best solution is to "require Net::SSLeay"
in one thread after all the threads have been created.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Random number generator not seeded!!!

B<(W)> This warning indicates that C<randomize()> was not able to read
C</dev/random> or C</dev/urandom>, possibly because your system does not
have them or they are differently named. You can still use SSL, but
the encryption will not be as strong.

=item open_tcp_connection: destination host not found:`server' (port 123) ($!)

Name lookup for host named C<server> failed.

=item open_tcp_connection: failed `server', 123 ($!)

The name was resolved, but establishing the TCP connection failed.

=item msg 123: 1 - error:140770F8:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown proto

SSLeay error string. The first number (123) is the PID, the second number
(1) indicates the position of the error message in SSLeay error stack.
You often see a pile of these messages as errors cascade.

=item msg 123: 1 - error:02001002::lib(2) :func(1) :reason(2)

The same as above, but you didn't call load_error_strings() so SSLeay
couldn't verbosely explain the error. You can still find out what it
means with this command:

    /usr/local/ssl/bin/ssleay errstr 02001002

=item Password is being asked for private key

This is normal behaviour if your private key is encrypted. Either
you have to supply the password or you have to use an unencrypted
private key. Scan OpenSSL.org for the FAQ that explains how to
do this (or just study examples/makecert.pl which is used
during C<make test> to do just that).

=back

=head1 SECURITY

You can mitigate some of the security vulnerabilities that might be present in your SSL/TLS application: 


=head2 BEAST Attack

http://blogs.cisco.com/security/beat-the-beast-with-tls/
https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/10/17/mitigating-the-beast-attack-on-tls
http://blog.zoller.lu/2011/09/beast-summary-tls-cbc-countermeasures.html

The BEAST attack relies on a weakness in the way CBC mode is used in SSL/TLS. 
In OpenSSL versions 0.9.6d and later, the protocol-level mitigation is enabled by default, 
thus making it not vulnerable to the BEAST attack.

Solutions:

=over

=item * Compile with OpenSSL versions 0.9.6d or later, which enables SSL_OP_ALL by default

=item * Ensure SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS is not enabled (its not enabled by default)

=item * Don't support SSLv2, SSLv3

=item * Actively control the ciphers your server supports with set_cipher_list:

=back

Net::SSLeay::set_cipher_list($ssl, 'RC4-SHA:HIGH:!ADH');


=head2 Session Resumption 

http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html

The SSL Labs vulnerability test on your SSL server might report in red:

Session resumption      No (IDs assigned but not accepted)

This report is not really bug or a vulnerability, since the server will not 
accept session resumption requests.
However, you can prevent this noise in the report by disabling the session cache altogether:
Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_session_cache_mode($ssl_ctx, 0);


=head2 Secure Renegotiation and DoS Attack

https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/10/31/tls-renegotiation-and-denial-of-service-attacks

This is not a "security flaw," it is more of a DoS vulnerability.

Solutions: 

=over

=item * Do not support SSLv2

=item * Do not set the SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION option

=item * Compile with OpenSSL 0.9.8m or later
